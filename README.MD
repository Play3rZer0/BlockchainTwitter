dTweet App (Ethereum)

This is a decentralized version of Twitter. This is a proof-of-concept only and not meant for production use.

Social media on a blockchain can be costly. For every tweet there is a cost associated to pay for gas on the Ethereum blockchain.

In normal social media anyone can post or tweet a message, but on a blockchain-based social media things work differently.

The good points about this are:

- Verification of ownership of a tweet or post
- Pseudonymous nature of identity
- Discourages spamming and other tactics by bad actors
